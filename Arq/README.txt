When you run the program a file dialog will display, so you 
can choose the file .asm to convert into .hack the new file 
will be created in the same path as the original. After this 
a new dialog will show, asking if you want to convert another 
file, if you do click YES and the file dialog will show again. 
In case you are done only click NO and the program will close.
